# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Conducting focus groups and interviewing end users and clients can help me identify the functions and features needed for the best end result.  Using this information, I can create user stories.  User stories tell what the desired feature is and why the user wants it.  It also lists the requirements to make this happen and gives an idea of the size of each project. 

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I enjoyed learning about Agile processes.  I like the high level of collaboration involved in the process.  I feel like developers are creative problem solvers and that is often done best in groups.  

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development means you are able to give and receive constructive criticism while still being respectful and amiable with your teammates.  Being a willing participant and open to communicating is a big help.
